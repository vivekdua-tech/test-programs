Why amazon?\
\
There is significant emphasis placed on phrasing answers using the STAR method. Each interviewer will ask 2-3 specific questions that directly relate to Amazon\'92s leadership principles. Practice the STAR method beforehand, and make sure all steps/actions reflect positively on you - even if the final outcome was negative.\

Amazon does behavioral interviewing, with STAR (Situation, Task, Actions, Results): Describe a situation where you succeeded wildly/you missed a deadline/you failed catastrophically. What did you do? What were the results? What did you learn?\

Allocate memory for a 2d array with only one malloc\
\
Use C to implement C++ class inheritance and virtual function\
\
Implement a trie data structure with insert, delete and lookup function. Write the code in the vim editor on the terminal. The programming language must be C.\

\
Look at and understand 2 bit manipulation functions, which one is faster, use gettimeofday to time the functions.\
\
\
The problems are almost the same as what others have posted here, but to answer them well, you'll have to be very familiar with C (yes, C not C++), command-line debugging, man page, and working with editors like Vim or Emacs.\
\
a lot of bit manipulation and pointer related questions. gdb is helpful, vim/emacs is required\
